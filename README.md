# TAIL

## SYNOPSIS

 `tail  [-r] [-q] [-c # | -n #] [file ...`

## DESCRIPTION

 ```
tail file...
   Displays the last part of a file.
   Numbers having a leading plus (‘+’) sign are relative to the beginning of the input. Numbers having a leading minus (‘-’) sign or no explicit sign are relative to the end of the input. The default starting location is the last 10 lines of the input.

tail -c number, --bytes=number
   The location is number bytes.

tail -n number, --lines=number
   The location is number lines.

tail -q      
   Suppresses printing of headers when multiple files are being examined.

tail -r 
   The -r option causes the input to be displayed in reverse order, by line.  Additionally, this option changes the meaning of the -b, -c and -n options.  When the -r option is specified, these options specify the number of bytes, lines or 512-byte blocks to display, instead of the bytes, lines or blocks from the beginning or end of the input from which to begin the display.  The default for the -r option is to display all of the input.

If more than a single file is specified, each file is preceded by a header consisting of the string “==> XXX <==” where “XXX” is the name of the file.
